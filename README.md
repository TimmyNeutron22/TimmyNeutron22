-  Oh, why hello there, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @TimmyNeutron22!
-  Iâ€™m really excited about learning how to code. I have a whole plan on contributing to a mod for another game. You will find that out some other time, or maybe never. Hehe, sorry!
-  Iâ€™m currently learning about how to code by looking at other coding references from the mod for the other game that I just previously talked about!
-  Again, Iâ€™m thinking about contributing to the mod I've been mentioning several times and make something special for that great mod!
-  How to reach me - Nowhere -- Sorry! I'm not giving you any of my social platforms. Thanks for asking anyway, everyone and/or GitHub, though!
-  Alright, everyone! Thanks for reading this, if you did. Bye now! ^^
